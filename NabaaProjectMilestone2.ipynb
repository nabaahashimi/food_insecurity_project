        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Food insecurity refers to the limited or uncertain availability of nutritious, affordable food. It does not only describe whether people have food in the moment, but whether they can reliably access healthy food options that support long-term well-being. Across the United States, food insecurity is strongly shaped by structural factors such as neighborhood poverty, access to transportation, distance to supermarkets, and broader socioeconomic conditions. These factors often combine to produce “food deserts,” where residents must travel long distances usually without a personal vehicle to reach a grocery store.\n",
        "\n",
        "To study these issues at a meaningful level of detail, this project uses census tracts as the primary unit of analysis. A census tract is a small, relatively permanent geographic region defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, typically containing 2,500–8,000 residents. Tracts are designed to represent neighborhoods with similar demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Census tracts allow for a more precise analysis of community-level differences in income, transportation access, and food availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key metric in this project is the “low-access” population, defined by the USDA Food Access Research Atlas. A resident is considered low-access if they live beyond a reasonable distance from a supermarket:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Urban tracts: more than 1 mile from a supermarket  \n",
        "- Rural tracts: more than 10 miles from a supermarket  \n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding food insecurity from a data science perspective requires integrating multiple sources of information. By combining tract-level measures (such as low-access populations, low-income rates, and vehicle availability) with county-level socioeconomic indicators (such as poverty rates, SNAP participation, and unemployment), we can explore how geographic, demographic, and economic factors interact to shape food availability across the country.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project focuses on the following research questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Q1:** How is census-tract or county-level food insecurity distributed across the United States, and what does the variation in its distribution reveal about geographic inequality?\n",
        "- **Q2:** What is the relationship between structural food-access barriers and food insecurity at the county level?  \n",
        "- **Q3:** How do socioeconomic and geographic factors shape food insecurity rates across U.S. counties?\n",
        "\n",
        "Addressing these questions through data cleaning, integration, exploratory analysis, and early modeling will prepare the foundation for building predictive models in the next milestone."

There is an average of 64% of residents living far from a supermarket and 22% facing both low income and low access. The large variation highlights unequal structural conditions. The small numbere of residents who are low-access and lack vehicle transportation points to disadvantages that can make obtaining food especially difficult."

Counties with higher food insecurity have higher shares of residents living far from supermarkets, suggesting that physical access plays an important role. However, the wide vertical spread at nearly every access level indicates that supermarket distance alone does not fully explain food insecurity—other socioeconomic factors, such as poverty and transportation barriers, also contribute. Overall, the plot highlights that food insecurity is shaped by multiple intersecting structural conditions."

This very small difference, also reflected in the bar chart below, suggests that food insecurity is not primarily an urban or rural issue but a widespread national challenge. The finding indicates that metro status alone is not a strong predictor of food insecurity, highlighting the need to consider additional socioeconomic factors to understand why some counties experience higher rates than others."

        "The analysis of food insecurity across county poverty levels shows a strong, consistent upward trend. Counties with higher poverty rates experience significantly higher food insecurity. Food insecurity rises from about 11% in low-poverty counties to over 30% in counties where poverty exceeds 30%. This is the clearest pattern in the EDA and highlights poverty as a major structural driver of food insecurity."

        "# Model Questions\n",
        "1. A first modeling approach is to predict county-level food insecurity rates using structural food-access and socioeconomic variables. The dependent variable is the CDC PLACES food insecurity rate, and the independent variables include supermarket low-access rates, low-income low-access rates, and no-vehicle low-access rates from the USDA Food Access Atlas, along with poverty rate, median household income, demographic composition, and metro status from the Food Environment Atlas. The EDA strongly supports this model since food insecurity rises with poverty and shows moderate associations with supermarket access barriers, and appears relatively stable across metro classifications. A multiple linear regression would allow me to quantify how each predictor contributes to food insecurity and assess how well these structural conditions explain geographic variation in the outcome.\n",
        "2. A second modeling direction is to turn the problem into a classification task by identifying counties with “high” food insecurity, defined as rates at or above 20%. The dependent variable becomes binary (high vs. low food insecurity), while the independent variables remain poverty indicators, access metrics, demographic characteristics, and metro status. The EDA results provide strong justification for doing this since the histogram shows a distinct right-skewed distribution with some counties experiencing much higher food insecurity."
