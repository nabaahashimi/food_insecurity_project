Extraction: The dataset was obtained directly from the USDA Food Access Research Atlas as a publicly available CSV file. It was downloaded and loaded into the notebook using pandas.read_csv().\n","2. Transformation: Unnecessary columns were filtered out for clarity, variable names were simplified for readability, data types (dtypes) were explicitly converted to numeric values to ensure accurate computations, missing values (NaN) were handled using fillna(0), derived columns such as low_income_rate (ratio of low-income population to total population) were computed to support analysis, data were validated for consistency and tidied so each row represents one census tract with clearly labeled variables.\n","3. Load: The clean dataset was stored in a pandas DataFrame (df), ready for exploratory analysis and modeling.\n","* EDA methods:\n","1. Summary Statistics: Used df.describe() to view mean, median, and distribution of major variables (low_income_pop, no_vehicle_households, etc.) to understand central tendencies and variation.\n","2. Correlations: Computed correlation coefficients between income, vehicle access, and food access variables to examine structural linkages.\n","3. Grouping and Comparison: Used groupby() to compare food access across urban vs. rural tracts and across states to reveal geographic disparities.\n","4. Visualization: Created visual summaries like Histogram of the population with low food access (sns.histplot()) and Scatter plot of income vs. vehicle access to visualize correlations.\n","5.

Discussion of EDA results and next steps\n","The histogram shows a highly right-skewed distribution of the low-access population across U.S. census tracts. Most tracts have relatively small populations experiencing limited food access (within 1 mile urban or 10 miles rural), while a small number of tracts have disproportionately high counts. This suggests that food inaccessibility is concentrated in specific regions rather than widespread evenly across all areas.\n","\n","The tall spike near zero indicates that the majority of census tracts have fewer than a few hundred residents facing limited access to grocery stores. In contrast, the long tail extending to the right highlights a subset of rural tracts where thousands of people live far from food sources, reflecting spatial isolation and infrastructure gaps.\n","\n","Overall, this pattern reveals uneven food access, where most communities are relatively well served but a minority face severe limitations. These high-value outliers are critical for targeted policy interventions, as they represent regions where geographic and socioeconomic disadvantages intersect to create heightened food insecurity."],"metadata":{"id":"sf87m4j7Xx8_"}}]}
